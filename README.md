# Bouq-It üåπ
This project was developed by students in the Ateneo de Manila University for their CSCI 42 (Introduction to Software Engineering) class.

Bouq-It (pronounced Book-It) is a flower delivery service. 
It is a play on words of ‚Äúbouquet‚Äù and the act of booking a delivery order. 
The primary purpose of Bouq-It is to provide a convenient and user-friendly platform for purchasing and customizing flower arrangements. 
It aims to support floral shops by offering them an online marketplace while giving customers flexibility in selecting or designing bouquets.
